# Problem Statement
Freelancers and gig workers often struggle to track multiple active projects, deadlines, and income status (Pending vs. Received) simultaneously. This lack of organization leads to missed deadlines and lost revenue.

# Scope
The "FreelanceFlow" system allows users to:
1. Create and manage client profiles.
2. Track project status (To Do -> In Progress -> Done).
3. Calculate pending vs. realized income.

# Target Users
Student freelancers, consultants, and gig economy workers.
